              "title": "This a continuation in my series of analytical reports for various cryptocurrencies, from a quantitative Excel modelling and fundamental perspective. These are the previous reports:\n\n* Part 1 - [A fundamental quantitative valuation of Bitcoin](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/7n47be/i_built_these_3_fundamental_valuation_models_for/)\n\n* Part 2 -  [A fundamental quantitative valuation of REQ (Request Network)](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/7njeff/a_fundamental_quantitative_valuation_of_req/)\n\nToday I will look at VeChain (known as VEN or VET), a supply chain focused cryptocurrency based in China. \n\n**If you already know about VeChain, you can skip to Section B for the valuation model**, however first a brief overview of the fundamentals:\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n#Section A: A fundamental analysis of VEN\n\n\n**Tech/Asset overview**\n\nVeChain Foundation: https://vechainfoundation.com/en/\n\nVeChain is a blockchain platform that focuses on the supply chain process, specifically the process of \"asset digitization\" through the combination of RFID/NFC tags and the immutability of a distributed blockchain. VeChain will use Ethereum as its core layer, and will be split into two tiers of different currencies:\n\n* VEN/VET: function of the VEN/VET is to serve as the intermedium of value and secure the network by being staked in nodes. VEN holders are rewarded with another asset called THOR POWER (THOR)\n\n* THOR Power represents the underlying cost of using the VeChain Blockchain and will be consumed (proportionally burnt) after certain blockchain operations are performed, such as transferring VET and executing smart contracts.\n\nYou can think of this an analogous to NEO and GAS, where the holding of one asset rewards with a type of \"dividend\" with another asset, and that secondary asset being what powers the network.\n\nThe equations and functions of this [can be found here](https://medium.com/@vechainofficial/vechain-apotheosis-part-ii-thor-power-forged-974111a93278)\n\n**Target Market Analysis: What is the transactional problem or inefficiency it attempts to solve?**\n\nOne of the major problems in global supply chain is the large amount of counterfeit items being passed around. Right now we have a very archaic system to deal with this, where for example luxury goods will have a paper \"certificate of authenticity\" that is really easy to copy and fake. \n\nVeChain plans to create a secure network where assets could be authenticated at the creation source and then tracked from party to party. Each item would have its own unique ID created with the SHA256 hash algorithm on the blockchain, and hence once entered in the platform could have its information accessed by anyone within the supply chain process. In addition the platform plans to provide the full spectrum of standard supply chain management tools through its smart contract platform and APIs. \n\nThe initial targeted industries will be those who suffer from the issue of asset validation and authentication, a problem all too familiar to Chinese supply chain companies. For example, think about a luxury handbag. A tiny RFID chip could be implanted in the packaging, or even within the bag itself, which would ensure ownership and authenticity.\n\n**What is the Development Team like?**\n\nVeChain has a technical development team of over 40 people, and nearly 150 in total. The key members on the team are:\n\n* Sunny Lu - Founder. Graduated from Shanghai Jiao Tong University, majored in Electronics and Communication\nEngineering. He has been served as IT Executive in Fortune 500 companies over 13 years, former CIO of Louis Vutton China.\n\n* Jay Zhang - Finance Director. Jay has worked for PwC and Deloitte as a senior manager for over 14 years.\n\n* Jianliang Gu - Technical Director. Jianliang was graduated from Shanghai University with master degree majored in Cybernetics. He was working in TCL communication technology as Technical Director.\n\n* Richard Fu - PR & Marketing Director. Ever 20 years' working experience in multinational enterprises such as Shangri-la Group and LVHM specializing in sales and marketing\n\n* Jerome Grilleres - Business Development. holds an MBA from London Business School and\na MSc in Computer Science. He is from Barclays France and has 8 years experience in Business Strategy and\nDevelopment in retail banking and 6 years in developing Real Time trading application in Investment Banks.\n\nIt is primarily based in China but has an office in Europe.\n\n**What current product/partnership exists?**\n\nVeChain does currently have several parts of a working product, from Android and iOS apps in the store to the initial platform code. Currently they are working on 3rd generation sensor for RFID tagging.\n\nPartnerships are perhaps VeChain's greatest initial strength. While certain partnerships like PriceWaterhouseCooper are oversold (at the time its largely an investment and advisory partnership), other partnerships within the Chinese industrial sphere are impressive:\n\n* Mlily, the largest memory foam mattress and smart bedding product research, development and manufacturer in China. Mlily will be utilizing VeChain Thor for Proof of Origin, Proof of Authenticity and Supply chain management. It is estimated that this project will add at least 20 million RFID chips every year for the next five years (blockchain data entry points) on chain. \n\n* Auto manufacturer Renault, an initial partnership to ensure that their manufacturing process is traceable across the supply chain.\n\n* VeChain officially established a cooperative relationship by signing a strategic agreement with Jiangsu Printed Electronics in November 2017. Both parties agreed that we would mutually explore and cooperate towards solutions within blockchain-centric IoT equipment.\n\n* Recommended by and initiated by a government member for Hubei province, VeChain partnered up with Hubei Sanxin Cultural Media Ltd to develop a series of solutions using VeChain blockchain technologies for the proof of origin, the supply chain management and the accounting of digital publications and ebooks. The first phase of this partnership will last for 2 years, to be extended at a later date. Importantly, if this pilot goes as planned the government of Hubei will recommend VeChain Thor Digital publication tracking solutions to The State Administration of Press, Publication, Radio, Film and Television of the People’s Republic of China. \n\n**What are the weaknesses/issues related with this cryptocurrency?**\n\n* Several other strong competitors within this same field, primarily Walton and WABI. VeChain will have to differentiate itself from them with a superior product or lower fees if it aims to secure the Chinese contracts. \n\n* Getting the ROI on THOR that will surpass your initial VET investment will likely require a multi-year hold. Small stake holders get substantially less THOR per VEN held, which will make non-node positions likely highly liquid and traded. This in turn reduces the value proposition for small holders.\n\n* It's a Chinese organization, meaning it has all the potential traps and risks of them. Most of the first hand information is in Chinese first. Even reading their English version of the Development Plan wil raise a few red flags since its filled with really poor grammar and comes off really unprofessional in the English language.\n\n* There is risk that the powernode users could come to dominate the network. \n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",

So if we can find estimate the transaction fees and THOR float generated and burned per year we could derive a price for THOR. This would be the expected future value of THOR, which can be discounted back to 2018 and then we can value different tiers of VEN stakes (nodes, masternodes, under 10K tokens) based on this information to arrive at a rational basis range for the price.\n\n**[Here is the output of the Excel Model](https://i.imgur.com/BIJTI2B.png)**\n\nThis model is inspired by Nodar Janashia's [model for valuing the Raiden Network](https://www.countup.io/cryptovaluations/raiden), which itself is inspired by Chris Brurniske's blogpost on creating a Cryptoasset Valuation. It uses the same underlying equation, the Fisher's Equation of Exchange (Quantity Theory of Money):\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equation_of_exchange\n\nThe equation MV= PQ can be thought of in terms of cryptocurrency, where \n\n* M is the monetary base (market cap) of the cryptocurrency\n* V is the velocity of the currency\n* P is the price of the digital medium underlying the currency transaction\n* Q is the quantity of the digital medium underlying the currency transaction\n\nIn order to value a cryptocurrency, we need to figure out the equation M = PQ/V for each year in future, divide it by the expected outstanding float and then discount the entire equation to derive the present value of this future utility. In my model I project the expected utility out 30 years until the year 2048, discounting back to 2018 and adding on a perpetuity for all years past 2048. \n\nThe term PQ is essentially the value of the cash flow that the \"economy\" of the cryptocurrency generates, for example for a cryptocurrency that focuses on being a token for online gaming (like FUN), the total value of the economy would be the gaming site revenue that is undertaken with the coin. For VEN, this term would be the value of the fees that are being paid in THOR power by companies and individuals for using the VeChain network. Once you divide that by velocity, you can discount it back to the present day. The final complexity is that VEN tokens generate a fixed amount of THOR per year depending on how much of a stake you hold, with nodes and masternodes generating more than individual VEN tokens. In addition the valuation is also dependent on how long the average person aims to hold the VEN token. If you hold a single token for just 1 year, you only get 0.15 THOR and however if you hold it for 6 then you are close to 1. The final sensitivity analysis is what will present the valuation depending on what the holder expect in terms of hold period in years and also how many VEN they have (node, masternode, under 10K).\n\nThe first section (Float Outstanding Schedule) aims to figure out how many THOR Power tokens will be available for burn each year. This depends on the outstanding float of VEN tokens. So far 12.6% of VEN has been burned, which leaves us with 867K VEN outstanding. I applied a 4% annual burn rate to this number, then figure out the number of THOR based on this number. The THOR reward per VEN can be figured out by applying the formula set out by VeChain Foundation:\n\nStake Type | VEN Held | THOR per year | THOR/VEN per year |  \n---------|----------|----------|----------|----------|----------\nThrudheim Masternode | 250,000 | 65,700 | 0.2628 | \nMjolnir Masternode | 150,000 | 39,420 | 0.2628 | \nThunder Node | 50,000 | 11,771 | 0.2354 | \nStrength Node | 10,000 | 2,080 | 0.208 |\nNon-Node | <10,000 |  | 0.15 | \n\nFor the model I break down users into the non-node bonded users (under 10K) and node bonded users (>10K). For the node bonded users, I will use an average of the masternode and node returns, which comes out to 0.2423 THOR/VEN each year. I assume a 50/50 split between these two groups.\n\nFor the transactional market, I'm assuming two different total relevant market inputs. One is the total market for counterfeit and fake goods economy, which [according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development accounts for $461 billion.](http://money.cnn.com/2016/04/18/news/economy/fake-purses-shoes-economy-counterfeit-trade/index.html) The second is the market for supply chain management software and various dApps, ICOs, extension...etc. The supply chain management market is around 17 billion according to Supply Chain Quarterly magazine, and another $120 billion will be the initial market for the other industries, growing to past $592 billion by 2038. The totality of these market segments is compounded by 5% every year, and growing to 2.58 trillion by 2048. I assume an S-Adoption curve that reaches 10% adoption in 2048 and starts in 2019, accelerating in 2022. The average fee is set at 3.5%, which I think is reasonable.\n\nNow the velocity of THOR is set at 1.0, because I don't expect it to be used as a currency for anything other than powering the VeChain network. The discount rate I used is 24%, or 3X the long term expected return on large cap equity (around 8%), to account for the risky nature of crypto.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nAfter deriving the NPV of THOR, we can give a valuation for VEN across a matrix of VEN stakes and average hold periods based on the assumptions within the image:\n\nStake Type (Node Tiers) | THOR/YEAR | 1 Year | 2 Years | 3 Years | 4 Years |  5 Years | 6 Years | 7 Years | 8 Years |  \n---------|----------|----------|----------|----------|----------|----------|----------|----------|----------\nThrudheim Masternode | 0.263 | $6.36 | $12.72 | $19.08 | $25.44 | $31.80 | $38.16 | $44.52 | $50.88 | \nMjolnir Masternode | 0.263 | $6.36 | $12.72 | $19.08 | $25.44 | $31.80 | $38.16 | $44.52 | $50.88 |\nThunder Node | 0.235 | $5.68 | $11.37| $17.05 | $22.73 | $28.41 | $34.10 | $39.78 | $45.46 | \nStrength Node | 0.208 | $5.03 | $10.06 | $15.03 | $20.12 | $25.15 | $30.18 | $35.21 | $40.24 |\nNon-Node | 0.15 | $3.63 | $7.25 | $10.88 | $14.51 | $18.14 | $21.76 | $25.39 | $29.02 | \n\n[Image of Table for Mobile Users](https://i.imgur.com/oZuBnOR.png)\n\nUltimately the valuation depends on what stake you hold in terms of node status and how long the average hold period is expected to be. Assuming a fundamental-based approach to investing, I think a 4 year average stake position period is reasonable which gives us between $14.51-$25.44 valuation. Longer periods and larger stakes take us up to $50.88 if you could secure a Thurdheim Masternode stake, a 10x premium over current prices.\n\nCreating a model for VEN really does make you think of these tokens as less of currencies and more as cryptoassets. People like to say that VEN pays a dividend in THOR, but I find it more helpful to think VEN as a financial derivative, its almost like a collaterized derivative contract. It also highlights how much of a disparity there is between the expected value for a non-node holder and the node holders. I expect this desire for node holders to move up to the next tier will put upward pressure. I should note that there is an additional complexity in that the top two node types (Thudheim and Mjolnir) get an additional 30% of THOR Power in the network, something I ignored in the model for simplicity. \n\nIn my view VEN and the general supply chain cryptos are some of the most promising, because they address real problems rather than imagined ones like so many crypto currencies. They also apply the properties of the blockchain to these problems in a way that makes sense rather than trying to fit something into the blockchain because its the trendy thing to do. Tracking identification numbers for unique items and luxury goods specifically is something that is well fitted for the blockchain. You can't fake them like you can fake a paper Certificate of Authenticity. \n\nAre these reasonable expectations? In the model by the year 2027 THOR Power is accounting for over $1.1 billion in transaction fees and by 2048 its up to $9 billion. Is a $9 billion annual fee economy in the long term something within the realm of reason? I think with so much revenue being lost to counterfeiting there will be a strong drive by companies to capture this back, and they will be willing to pay for a solution similar to VEN. If VEN can capture even 10% of that lost revenue, the holders are in for a great time over the long term. What about more optimistic adoption curves? Well if we ratchet up expectations we get the following 4 year average hold valuations:\n\n* 15% adoption: $20-$35 per VEN\n\n* 20% adoption: $27-$48 per VEN\n\n* 25% adoption: $34-$60 per VEN\n\n* 30% adoption: $40-$71 per VEN\n\nI think this provides an interesting way of valuing one of the most promising projects in crypto with a sceptic eye while fully recognizing the potential. That's what great about modelling, they allow you to keep your expectations within the realms of reality while also checking that VEN isn't overvalued, because most other coins in crypto definitely are.\n\n**Final Rating: UNDERVALUED**\n\n*DIsclaimer: I currently hold 560 VEN bought at $1.20. I will continue to hold and add on the dips.*\n\n",

Just as a grey market good counterfeiters counterfeit the goods, they can just as easily spoof the website used to validate the authenticity of the origin of those goods.

These are the previous reports:\n\n* Part 1 - [A fundamental quantitative valuation of Bitcoin](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/7n47be/i_built_these_3_fundamental_valuation_models_for/)\n\n* Part 2 -  [A fundamental quantitative valuation of REQ (Request Network)](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/7njeff/a_fundamental_quantitative_valuation_of_req/)\n\nToday I will look at VeChain (known as VEN or VET), a supply chain focused cryptocurrency based in China. \n\n**If you already know about VeChain, you can skip to Section B for the valuation model**, however first a brief overview of the fundamentals:\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n#Section A: A fundamental analysis of VEN\n\n\n**Tech/Asset overview**\n\nVeChain Foundation: https://vechainfoundation.com/en/\n\nVeChain is a blockchain platform that focuses on the supply chain process, specifically the process of \"asset digitization\" through the combination of RFID/NFC tags and the immutability of a distributed blockchain. VeChain will use Ethereum as its core layer, and will be split into two tiers of different currencies:\n\n* VEN/VET: function of the VEN/VET is to serve as the intermedium of value and secure the network by being staked in nodes. VEN holders are rewarded with another asset called THOR POWER (THOR)\n\n* THOR Power represents the underlying cost of using the VeChain Blockchain and will be consumed (proportionally burnt) after certain blockchain operations are performed, such as transferring VET and executing smart contracts.\n\nYou can think of this an analogous to NEO and GAS, where the holding of one asset rewards with a type of \"dividend\" with another asset, and that secondary asset being what powers the network.\n\nThe equations and functions of this [can be found here](https://medium.com/@vechainofficial/vechain-apotheosis-part-ii-thor-power-forged-974111a93278)\n\n**Target Market Analysis: What is the transactional problem or inefficiency it attempts to solve?**\n\nOne of the major problems in global supply chain is the large amount of counterfeit items being passed around. Right now we have a very archaic system to deal with this, where for example luxury goods will have a paper \"certificate of authenticity\" that is really easy to copy and fake. \n\nVeChain plans to create a secure network where assets could be authenticated at the creation source and then tracked from party to party. Each item would have its own unique ID created with the SHA256 hash algorithm on the blockchain, and hence once entered in the platform could have its information accessed by anyone within the supply chain process. In addition the platform plans to provide the full spectrum of standard supply chain management tools through its smart contract platform and APIs. \n\nThe initial targeted industries will be those who suffer from the issue of asset validation and authentication, a problem all too familiar to Chinese supply chain companies. For example, think about a luxury handbag. A tiny RFID chip could be implanted in the packaging, or even within the bag itself, which would ensure ownership and authenticity.\n\n**What is the Development Team like?**\n\nVeChain has a technical development team of over 40 people, and nearly 150 in total. The key members on the team are:\n\n* Sunny Lu - Founder. Graduated from Shanghai Jiao Tong University, majored in Electronics and Communication\nEngineering. He has been served as IT Executive in Fortune 500 companies over 13 years, former CIO of Louis Vutton China.\n\n* Jay Zhang - Finance Director. Jay has worked for PwC and Deloitte as a senior manager for over 14 years.\n\n* Jianliang Gu - Technical Director. Jianliang was graduated from Shanghai University with master degree majored in Cybernetics. He was working in TCL communication technology as Technical Director.\n\n* Richard Fu - PR & Marketing Director. Ever 20 years' working experience in multinational enterprises such as Shangri-la Group and LVHM specializing in sales and marketing\n\n* Jerome Grilleres - Business Development. holds an MBA from London Business School and\na MSc in Computer Science. He is from Barclays France and has 8 years experience in Business Strategy and\nDevelopment in retail banking and 6 years in developing Real Time trading application in Investment Banks.\n\nIt is primarily based in China but has an office in Europe.\n\n**What current product/partnership exists?**\n\nVeChain does currently have several parts of a working product, from Android and iOS apps in the store to the initial platform code. Currently they are working on 3rd generation sensor for RFID tagging.\n\nPartnerships are perhaps VeChain's greatest initial strength. While certain partnerships like PriceWaterhouseCooper are oversold (at the time its largely an investment and advisory partnership), other partnerships within the Chinese industrial sphere are impressive:\n\n* Mlily, the largest memory foam mattress and smart bedding product research, development and manufacturer in China. Mlily will be utilizing VeChain Thor for Proof of Origin, Proof of Authenticity and Supply chain management. It is estimated that this project will add at least 20 million RFID chips every year for the next five years (blockchain data entry points) on chain. \n\n* Auto manufacturer Renault, an initial partnership to ensure that their manufacturing process is traceable across the supply chain.\n\n* VeChain officially established a cooperative relationship by signing a strategic agreement with Jiangsu Printed Electronics in November 2017. Both parties agreed that we would mutually explore and cooperate towards solutions within blockchain-centric IoT equipment.\n\n* Recommended by and initiated by a government member for Hubei province, VeChain partnered up with Hubei Sanxin Cultural Media Ltd to develop a series of solutions using VeChain blockchain technologies for the proof of origin, the supply chain management and the accounting of digital publications and ebooks. The first phase of this partnership will last for 2 years, to be extended at a later date. Importantly, if this pilot goes as planned the government of Hubei will recommend VeChain Thor Digital publication tracking solutions to The State Administration of Press, Publication, Radio, Film and Television of the People’s Republic of China. \n\n**What are the weaknesses/issues related with this cryptocurrency?**\n\n* Several other strong competitors within this same field, primarily Walton and WABI. VeChain will have to differentiate itself from them with a superior product or lower fees if it aims to secure the Chinese contracts. \n\n* Getting the ROI on THOR that will surpass your initial VET investment will likely require a multi-year hold. Small stake holders get substantially less THOR per VEN held, which will make non-node positions likely highly liquid and traded. This in turn reduces the value proposition for small holders.\n\n* It's a Chinese organization, meaning it has all the potential traps and risks of them. Most of the first hand information is in Chinese first. Even reading their English version of the Development Plan wil raise a few red flags since its filled with really poor grammar and comes off really unprofessional in the English language.\n\n* There is risk that the powernode users could come to dominate the network. \n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",

He has been served as IT Executive in Fortune 500 companies over 13 years, former CIO of Louis Vutton China.\n\n* Jay Zhang - Finance Director. Jay has worked for PwC and Deloitte as a senior manager for over 14 years.\n\n* Jianliang Gu - Technical Director. Jianliang was graduated from Shanghai University with master degree majored in Cybernetics. He was working in TCL communication technology as Technical Director.\n\n* Richard Fu - PR & Marketing Director. Ever 20 years' working experience in multinational enterprises such as Shangri-la Group and LVHM specializing in sales and marketing\n\n* Jerome Grilleres - Business Development. holds an MBA from London Business School and\na MSc in Computer Science.

Currently they are working on 3rd generation sensor for RFID tagging.\n\nPartnerships are perhaps VeChain's greatest initial strength. While certain partnerships like PriceWaterhouseCooper are oversold (at the time its largely an investment and advisory partnership), other partnerships within the Chinese industrial sphere are impressive:\n\n* Mlily, the largest memory foam mattress and smart bedding product research, development and manufacturer in China. Mlily will be utilizing VeChain Thor for Proof of Origin, Proof of Authenticity and Supply chain management. It is estimated that this project will add at least 20 million RFID chips every year for the next five years (blockchain data entry points) on chain. \n\n* Auto manufacturer Renault, an initial partnership to ensure that their manufacturing process is traceable across the supply chain.\n\n* VeChain officially established a cooperative relationship by signing a strategic agreement with Jiangsu Printed Electronics in November 2017. Both parties agreed that we would mutually explore and cooperate towards solutions within blockchain-centric IoT equipment.\n\n* Recommended by and initiated by a government member for Hubei province, VeChain partnered up with Hubei Sanxin Cultural Media Ltd to develop a series of solutions using VeChain blockchain technologies for the proof of origin, the supply chain management and the accounting of digital publications and ebooks. The first phase of this partnership will last for 2 years, to be extended at a later date. Importantly, if this pilot goes as planned the government of Hubei will recommend VeChain Thor Digital publication tracking solutions to The State Administration of Press, Publication, Radio, Film and Television of the People’s Republic of China. \n\n**What are the weaknesses/issues related with this cryptocurrency?**\n\n* Several other strong competitors within this same field, primarily Walton and WABI. VeChain will have to differentiate itself from them with a superior product or lower fees if it aims to secure the Chinese contracts. \n\n* Getting the ROI on THOR that will surpass your initial VET investment will likely require a multi-year hold. Small stake holders get substantially less THOR per VEN held, which will make non-node positions likely highly liquid and traded. This in turn reduces the value proposition for small holders.\n\n* It's a Chinese organization, meaning it has all the potential traps and risks of them. Most of the first hand information is in Chinese first. Even reading their English version of the Development Plan wil raise a few red flags since its filled with really poor grammar and comes off really unprofessional in the English language.\n\n* There is risk that the powernode users could come to dominate the network. \n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",

These are the previous reports:\n\n* Part 1 - [A fundamental quantitative valuation of Bitcoin](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/7n47be/i_built_these_3_fundamental_valuation_models_for/)\n\n* Part 2 -  [A fundamental quantitative valuation of REQ (Request Network)](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/7njeff/a_fundamental_quantitative_valuation_of_req/)\n\nToday I will look at VeChain (known as VEN or VET), a supply chain focused cryptocurrency based in China. \n\n**If you already know about VeChain, you can skip to Section B for the valuation model**, however first a brief overview of the fundamentals:\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n#Section A: A fundamental analysis of VEN\n\n\n**Tech/Asset overview**\n\nVeChain Foundation: https://vechainfoundation.com/en/\n\nVeChain is a blockchain platform that focuses on the supply chain process, specifically the process of \"asset digitization\" through the combination of RFID/NFC tags and the immutability of a distributed blockchain. VeChain will use Ethereum as its core layer, and will be split into two tiers of different currencies:\n\n* VEN/VET: function of the VEN/VET is to serve as the intermedium of value and secure the network by being staked in nodes. VEN holders are rewarded with another asset called THOR POWER (THOR)\n\n* THOR Power represents the underlying cost of using the VeChain Blockchain and will be consumed (proportionally burnt) after certain blockchain operations are performed, such as transferring VET and executing smart contracts.\n\nYou can think of this an analogous to NEO and GAS, where the holding of one asset rewards with a type of \"dividend\" with another asset, and that secondary asset being what powers the network.\n\nThe equations and functions of this [can be found here](https://medium.com/@vechainofficial/vechain-apotheosis-part-ii-thor-power-forged-974111a93278)\n\n**Target Market Analysis: What is the transactional problem or inefficiency it attempts to solve?**\n\nOne of the major problems in global supply chain is the large amount of counterfeit items being passed around. Right now we have a very archaic system to deal with this, where for example luxury goods will have a paper \"certificate of authenticity\" that is really easy to copy and fake. \n\nVeChain plans to create a secure network where assets could be authenticated at the creation source and then tracked from party to party. Each item would have its own unique ID created with the SHA256 hash algorithm on the blockchain, and hence once entered in the platform could have its information accessed by anyone within the supply chain process. In addition the platform plans to provide the full spectrum of standard supply chain management tools through its smart contract platform and APIs. \n\nThe initial targeted industries will be those who suffer from the issue of asset validation and authentication, a problem all too familiar to Chinese supply chain companies. For example, think about a luxury handbag. A tiny RFID chip could be implanted in the packaging, or even within the bag itself, which would ensure ownership and authenticity.\n\n**What is the Development Team like?**\n\nVeChain has a technical development team of over 40 people, and nearly 150 in total. The key members on the team are:\n\n* Sunny Lu - Founder. Graduated from Shanghai Jiao Tong University, majored in Electronics and Communication\nEngineering. He has been served as IT Executive in Fortune 500 companies over 13 years, former CIO of Louis Vutton China.\n\n* Jay Zhang - Finance Director.

              "title": "---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n#Section B: Quantitative Valuation Model for VEN\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Equation of Exchange Model**\n\nVeChain tokens derive their value from generating THOR Power (THOR), which will be used to pay transaction costs within the network and blockchain. So if we can find estimate the transaction fees and THOR float generated and burned per year we could derive a price for THOR. This would be the expected future value of THOR, which can be discounted back to 2018 and then we can value different tiers of VEN stakes (nodes, masternodes, under 10K tokens) based on this information to arrive at a rational basis range for the price.\n\n**[Here is the output of the Excel Model](https://i.imgur.com/BIJTI2B.png)**\n\nThis model is inspired by Nodar Janashia's [model for valuing the Raiden Network](https://www.countup.io/cryptovaluations/raiden), which itself is inspired by Chris Brurniske's blogpost on creating a Cryptoasset Valuation. It uses the same underlying equation, the Fisher's Equation of Exchange (Quantity Theory of Money):\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equation_of_exchange\n\nThe equation MV= PQ can be thought of in terms of cryptocurrency, where \n\n* M is the monetary base (market cap) of the cryptocurrency\n* V is the velocity of the currency\n* P is the price of the digital medium underlying the currency transaction\n* Q is the quantity of the digital medium underlying the currency transaction\n\nIn order to value a cryptocurrency, we need to figure out the equation M = PQ/V for each year in future, divide it by the expected outstanding float and then discount the entire equation to derive the present value of this future utility. In my model I project the expected utility out 30 years until the year 2048, discounting back to 2018 and adding on a perpetuity for all years past 2048. \n\nThe term PQ is essentially the value of the cash flow that the \"economy\" of the cryptocurrency generates, for example for a cryptocurrency that focuses on being a token for online gaming (like FUN), the total value of the economy would be the gaming site revenue that is undertaken with the coin. For VEN, this term would be the value of the fees that are being paid in THOR power by companies and individuals for using the VeChain network. Once you divide that by velocity, you can discount it back to the present day. The final complexity is that VEN tokens generate a fixed amount of THOR per year depending on how much of a stake you hold, with nodes and masternodes generating more than individual VEN tokens. In addition the valuation is also dependent on how long the average person aims to hold the VEN token. If you hold a single token for just 1 year, you only get 0.15 THOR and however if you hold it for 6 then you are close to 1. The final sensitivity analysis is what will present the valuation depending on what the holder expect in terms of hold period in years and also how many VEN they have (node, masternode, under 10K).\n\nThe first section (Float Outstanding Schedule) aims to figure out how many THOR Power tokens will be available for burn each year. This depends on the outstanding float of VEN tokens. So far 12.6% of VEN has been burned, which leaves us with 867K VEN outstanding. I applied a 4% annual burn rate to this number, then figure out the number of THOR based on this number. The THOR reward per VEN can be figured out by applying the formula set out by VeChain Foundation:\n\nStake Type | VEN Held | THOR per year | THOR/VEN per year |  \n---------|----------|----------|----------|----------|----------\nThrudheim Masternode | 250,000 | 65,700 | 0.2628 | \nMjolnir Masternode | 150,000 | 39,420 | 0.2628 | \nThunder Node | 50,000 | 11,771 | 0.2354 | \nStrength Node | 10,000 | 2,080 | 0.208 |\nNon-Node | <10,000 |  | 0.15 | \n\nFor the model I break down users into the non-node bonded users (under 10K) and node bonded users (>10K). For the node bonded users, I will use an average of the masternode and node returns, which comes out to 0.2423 THOR/VEN each year. I assume a 50/50 split between these two groups.\n\nFor the transactional market, I'm assuming two different total relevant market inputs. One is the total market for counterfeit and fake goods economy, which [according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development accounts for $461 billion.](http://money.cnn.com/2016/04/18/news/economy/fake-purses-shoes-economy-counterfeit-trade/index.html) The second is the market for supply chain management software and various dApps, ICOs, extension...etc. The supply chain management market is around 17 billion according to Supply Chain Quarterly magazine, and another $120 billion will be the initial market for the other industries, growing to past $592 billion by 2038. The totality of these market segments is compounded by 5% every year, and growing to 2.58 trillion by 2048. I assume an S-Adoption curve that reaches 10% adoption in 2048 and starts in 2019, accelerating in 2022. The average fee is set at 3.5%, which I think is reasonable.\n\nNow the velocity of THOR is set at 1.0, because I don't expect it to be used as a currency for anything other than powering the VeChain network. The discount rate I used is 24%, or 3X the long term expected return on large cap equity (around 8%), to account for the risky nature of crypto.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nAfter deriving the NPV of THOR, we can give a valuation for VEN across a matrix of VEN stakes and average hold periods based on the assumptions within the image:\n\nStake Type (Node Tiers) | THOR/YEAR | 1 Year | 2 Years | 3 Years | 4 Years |  5 Years | 6 Years | 7 Years | 8 Years |  \n---------|----------|----------|----------|----------|----------|----------|----------|----------|----------\nThrudheim Masternode | 0.263 | $6.36 | $12.72 | $19.08 | $25.44 | $31.80 | $38.16 | $44.52 | $50.88 | \nMjolnir Masternode | 0.263 | $6.36 | $12.72 | $19.08 | $25.44 | $31.80 | $38.16 | $44.52 | $50.88 |\nThunder Node | 0.235 | $5.68 | $11.37| $17.05 | $22.73 | $28.41 | $34.10 | $39.78 | $45.46 | \nStrength Node | 0.208 | $5.03 | $10.06 | $15.03 | $20.12 | $25.15 | $30.18 | $35.21 | $40.24 |\nNon-Node | 0.15 | $3.63 | $7.25 | $10.88 | $14.51 | $18.14 | $21.76 | $25.39 | $29.02 | \n\n[Image of Table for Mobile Users](https://i.imgur.com/oZuBnOR.png)\n\nUltimately the valuation depends on what stake you hold in terms of node status and how long the average hold period is expected to be. Assuming a fundamental-based approach to investing, I think a 4 year average stake position period is reasonable which gives us between $14.51-$25.44 valuation. Longer periods and larger stakes take us up to $50.88 if you could secure a Thurdheim Masternode stake, a 10x premium over current prices.\n\nCreating a model for VEN really does make you think of these tokens as less of currencies and more as cryptoassets. People like to say that VEN pays a dividend in THOR, but I find it more helpful to think VEN as a financial derivative, its almost like a collaterized derivative contract. It also highlights how much of a disparity there is between the expected value for a non-node holder and the node holders. I expect this desire for node holders to move up to the next tier will put upward pressure. I should note that there is an additional complexity in that the top two node types (Thudheim and Mjolnir) get an additional 30% of THOR Power in the network, something I ignored in the model for simplicity. \n\nIn my view VEN and the general supply chain cryptos are some of the most promising, because they address real problems rather than imagined ones like so many crypto currencies. They also apply the properties of the blockchain to these problems in a way that makes sense rather than trying to fit something into the blockchain because its the trendy thing to do. Tracking identification numbers for unique items and luxury goods specifically is something that is well fitted for the blockchain. You can't fake them like you can fake a paper Certificate of Authenticity. \n\nAre these reasonable expectations? In the model by the year 2027 THOR Power is accounting for over $1.1 billion in transaction fees and by 2048 its up to $9 billion. Is a $9 billion annual fee economy in the long term something within the realm of reason? I think with so much revenue being lost to counterfeiting there will be a strong drive by companies to capture this back, and they will be willing to pay for a solution similar to VEN. If VEN can capture even 10% of that lost revenue, the holders are in for a great time over the long term. What about more optimistic adoption curves? Well if we ratchet up expectations we get the following 4 year average hold valuations:\n\n* 15% adoption: $20-$35 per VEN\n\n* 20% adoption: $27-$48 per VEN\n\n* 25% adoption: $34-$60 per VEN\n\n* 30% adoption: $40-$71 per VEN\n\nI think this provides an interesting way of valuing one of the most promising projects in crypto with a sceptic eye while fully recognizing the potential. That's what great about modelling, they allow you to keep your expectations within the realms of reality while also checking that VEN isn't overvalued, because most other coins in crypto definitely are.\n\n**Final Rating: UNDERVALUED**\n\n*DIsclaimer: I currently hold 560 VEN bought at $1.20. I will continue to hold and add on the dips.*\n\n",

              "title": "ELI5 of Bounty0x: \"freelance-hackers\" are always looking to find weaknesses in company's code. For companies, freelancing is way more efficient than contracting security experts since bounties are much more motivating and challenging than paying wages. In addition, there are a lot of skillful freelancer without a proper certificate or education (many of them are self-taught), so it is always pretty hard for companies to find good personnel in this business. Until now, companies often just didn't pay those, either because in their opinion the discovery didn't qualify for the published bounty or because it was unclear who gets paid since there were mostly a group of people discovering a certain issue. Freelancer not getting paid damaged the security-industry obviously. But with Bounty0x, companies can set bounties for discovering safety issues. They are binded to the smart contract and as soon as someone discovers an issue, he will get rewarded automatically. This will attract those bounty hunters which will not only increase overall network security but also let them getting paid for their work, which is awesome.\n\n\nThis is just a perfect example of how smart contracts can be used to create a benefit for both companies and people. To me it looks like an ideal investment since it's not even top200 in MC. \n\nI know i'm obviously shilling hard but it's an idea i can get behind and if it gets people attention, many security issues for example in cryptoexchanges can be removed which would be a huge benefit for the cryptocommunity overall.

Verge or Tron or all these other hyped-up shills.  \n\nPersonally, I'd just make an \"alt-coin fund\" . Choose like 10-15. That spreads your risk.\nFor example, if you have 5k, put it into-----\nNEO\nXLM\nSUB\nWABI\nQST\nICX\nPOWR\nREQ\nLEND\nLTC\n\nIs that risky? sure, but some of those coins will moon. so, you'll have profits over time no doubt",

              "title": "So there's been quite a bit of noise around SALT over the past ~2 weeks, and with news surfacing every couple days it seems like a good point to take stock of where the SALT loan arbitrage opportunity really stands.\n\nFor those unaware, SALT is a loan platform that allows members to post cryptocurrency as collateral in order to receive a fiat loan. Members have the option to repay loans with SALT, which is the native token of the platform. SALT is redeemable at a fixed price, currently $27.50, and the announcement accompanying platform launch included an unexpected note that loan principal could be repaid with SALT (pre-launch messaging indicated interest only). Currently, SALT trades at around $14.\n\nOur take is that the loan arbitrage is real, but because SALT can't be used for early repayment (as clarified by a SALT employee about a day ago) it's hard to say how quickly the exchange price will converge towards the $27.50 redemption value on the SALT platform. On one hand, this could be a good thing for those holding longer term or interested in actually getting a loan approved before buying SALT, but it's a negative event to speculators hoping for a quick flip. We are also not certain that SALT will not introduce further restrictive conditions, so for this and other reasons we will not be entering a position in SALT.",

This makes it seem to be a \"next-gen-Ethereum\" and if the technology actually works, then it would have the potential to be huge. There is also one of the advisers/devs/whoever, Vlad Zamfir, who is also working on Ethereum's Casper PoS. There are some bigger names in the RChain group. The review says that the time frame is long, potentially 5+ years. With that said, this may be a sleeper for me. Or an invest small amount now, and a bit more if things pick up.",

              "title": "Thinking it is a scam is an understandable initial reaction. I have done much research and have decided it is unlikely to be a scam. It may fail for other reasons but I am convinced the company is operating in good faith. My reasoning is as follows.\n\n* A scam would probably have exited by now. They spent a month raising $1m (now more like $2-3m given the runup in the crypto market). Then they spent two months without any fundraising, just providing updates to investors, releasing a demo video of the product, and re-branding from Pink to PinkDate to avoid confusion with Pink.io (a company that provides models-on-demand, not escorts). They even pushed back the Pre-ICO by about a week. This is behavior inconsistent with people trying to raise a lot of money quickly and then take off.\n\n* Scammers would probably not be as concerned about opsec as /u/ecnei has been. Check his Reddit history. He is active on the Monero community in dissecting privacy issues with Monero. His concerns strongly suggest someone who is trying to avoid a large government/multinational investigation rather than jilted ICO bagholders.\n\n* Bothering with Monero at all is a sign that they are not scammers, because it makes the investment process more complex. They strongly recommend Monero for investor privacy. An ICO scam would likely take mainly ETH, as it is the least friction to raise money quickly. Then the scammers could Shapeshift the ETH into Monero and take off.\n\n* For Pre-ICO they currently require a minimum investment size of ~$1000. This suggests they are not trying to scam nickel and dime investors. It drastically increases investment friction, which a scammer would have no motive to do.\n\n* Marketing competence is incredibly lacking. They have had several months now to raise hype and startup capital. Instead, they have spent their time releasing Medium articles, a demo video that is explanatory but not slick/exciting, and communicating behind-the-scenes infrastructure changes to investors. If they are scammers, they have done a terrible job. To their credit, their marketing is improving. But I believe scammers would have *started* with a marketing push rather than starting one several months later.\n\n* They did not even release a whitepaper for about three months, which makes sense for people who are not really trying to create new crypto tech, but does not make sense for people trying to appeal to get-rich-quick ICO investors. \n\nHaving read through their [Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/pinkdate/shared_invite/enQtMjQ0NjI2MDM0ODY1LWJhMGQ5ZTY4ZjRmODFlMTRlYWU3NDUwYWMzMDA1MGVlZGE1NThlN2ZjMWE2NGYxODRmNmY2NTg1YWI2MWM0YTk), their [Medium](https://medium.com/@PinkDate) articles, etc I have become convinced they are earnest and have a solid business plan. The thought and care they put into their [opsec](https://medium.com/@PinkDate/pink-app-trading-latency-for-anonymity-and-other-techniques-815ee21c6da4), as well as their in-depth knowledge of the sex industry, suggests they are what they claim to be: individuals with startup and opsec experience who see how crypto can be leveraged to meet a unique and extremely lucrative market.\n\nUltimately no answer can really be fully satisfying, because at the end of the day, they could just be high IQ scammers (and admit as such in their [FAQ](https://pinkdate.is/faq/)).\n\nI believe this is a calculated risk with a very high chance of paying off. Most ICOs are vaporware with a tenuous business plan involving staking or network incentives. The teams may not be anonymous, but even with the rise in ICO scams, nobody has been prosecuted because the crypto space is not regulated. The BitConnect people have gotten incredibly rich and will never pay a penny in restitution or see a day in prison.\n\nTo me, the risk of an anonymous team with a reasonable business proposition is much less than the risk of a named team with only \"network incentives\" for a network that may never actually exist. But I cannot deny that it *is* a risk.",

              "title": "This a continuation in my series of analytical reports for various cryptocurrencies, from a quantitative Excel modelling and fundamental perspective. These are the previous reports:\n\n* Part 1 - [A fundamental quantitative valuation of Bitcoin](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/7n47be/i_built_these_3_fundamental_valuation_models_for/)\n\n* Part 2 -  [A fundamental quantitative valuation of REQ (Request Network)](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/7njeff/a_fundamental_quantitative_valuation_of_req/)\n\nToday I will look at VeChain (known as VEN or VET), a supply chain focused cryptocurrency based in China. \n\n**If you already know about VeChain, you can skip to Section B for the valuation model**, however first a brief overview of the fundamentals:\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n#Section A: A fundamental analysis of VEN\n\n\n**Tech/Asset overview**\n\nVeChain Foundation: https://vechainfoundation.com/en/\n\nVeChain is a blockchain platform that focuses on the supply chain process, specifically the process of \"asset digitization\" through the combination of RFID/NFC tags and the immutability of a distributed blockchain. VeChain will use Ethereum as its core layer, and will be split into two tiers of different currencies:\n\n* VEN/VET: function of the VEN/VET is to serve as the intermedium of value and secure the network by being staked in nodes. VEN holders are rewarded with another asset called THOR POWER (THOR)\n\n* THOR Power represents the underlying cost of using the VeChain Blockchain and will be consumed (proportionally burnt) after certain blockchain operations are performed, such as transferring VET and executing smart contracts.\n\nYou can think of this an analogous to NEO and GAS, where the holding of one asset rewards with a type of \"dividend\" with another asset, and that secondary asset being what powers the network.\n\nThe equations and functions of this [can be found here](https://medium.com/@vechainofficial/vechain-apotheosis-part-ii-thor-power-forged-974111a93278)\n\n**Target Market Analysis: What is the transactional problem or inefficiency it attempts to solve?**\n\nOne of the major problems in global supply chain is the large amount of counterfeit items being passed around. Right now we have a very archaic system to deal with this, where for example luxury goods will have a paper \"certificate of authenticity\" that is really easy to copy and fake. \n\nVeChain plans to create a secure network where assets could be authenticated at the creation source and then tracked from party to party. Each item would have its own unique ID created with the SHA256 hash algorithm on the blockchain, and hence once entered in the platform could have its information accessed by anyone within the supply chain process. In addition the platform plans to provide the full spectrum of standard supply chain management tools through its smart contract platform and APIs. \n\nThe initial targeted industries will be those who suffer from the issue of asset validation and authentication, a problem all too familiar to Chinese supply chain companies. For example, think about a luxury handbag. A tiny RFID chip could be implanted in the packaging, or even within the bag itself, which would ensure ownership and authenticity.\n\n**What is the Development Team like?**\n\nVeChain has a technical development team of over 40 people, and nearly 150 in total. The key members on the team are:\n\n* Sunny Lu - Founder. Graduated from Shanghai Jiao Tong University, majored in Electronics and Communication\nEngineering. He has been served as IT Executive in Fortune 500 companies over 13 years, former CIO of Louis Vutton China.\n\n* Jay Zhang - Finance Director. Jay has worked for PwC and Deloitte as a senior manager for over 14 years.\n\n* Jianliang Gu - Technical Director. Jianliang was graduated from Shanghai University with master degree majored in Cybernetics. He was working in TCL communication technology as Technical Director.\n\n* Richard Fu - PR & Marketing Director. Ever 20 years' working experience in multinational enterprises such as Shangri-la Group and LVHM specializing in sales and marketing\n\n* Jerome Grilleres - Business Development. holds an MBA from London Business School and\na MSc in Computer Science. He is from Barclays France and has 8 years experience in Business Strategy and\nDevelopment in retail banking and 6 years in developing Real Time trading application in Investment Banks.\n\nIt is primarily based in China but has an office in Europe.\n\n**What current product/partnership exists?**\n\nVeChain does currently have several parts of a working product, from Android and iOS apps in the store to the initial platform code. Currently they are working on 3rd generation sensor for RFID tagging.\n\nPartnerships are perhaps VeChain's greatest initial strength. While certain partnerships like PriceWaterhouseCooper are oversold (at the time its largely an investment and advisory partnership), other partnerships within the Chinese industrial sphere are impressive:\n\n* Mlily, the largest memory foam mattress and smart bedding product research, development and manufacturer in China. Mlily will be utilizing VeChain Thor for Proof of Origin, Proof of Authenticity and Supply chain management. It is estimated that this project will add at least 20 million RFID chips every year for the next five years (blockchain data entry points) on chain. \n\n* Auto manufacturer Renault, an initial partnership to ensure that their manufacturing process is traceable across the supply chain.\n\n* VeChain officially established a cooperative relationship by signing a strategic agreement with Jiangsu Printed Electronics in November 2017. Both parties agreed that we would mutually explore and cooperate towards solutions within blockchain-centric IoT equipment.\n\n* Recommended by and initiated by a government member for Hubei province, VeChain partnered up with Hubei Sanxin Cultural Media Ltd to develop a series of solutions using VeChain blockchain technologies for the proof of origin, the supply chain management and the accounting of digital publications and ebooks. The first phase of this partnership will last for 2 years, to be extended at a later date. Importantly, if this pilot goes as planned the government of Hubei will recommend VeChain Thor Digital publication tracking solutions to The State Administration of Press, Publication, Radio, Film and Television of the People’s Republic of China. \n\n**What are the weaknesses/issues related with this cryptocurrency?**\n\n* Several other strong competitors within this same field, primarily Walton and WABI. VeChain will have to differentiate itself from them with a superior product or lower fees if it aims to secure the Chinese contracts. \n\n* Getting the ROI on THOR that will surpass your initial VET investment will likely require a multi-year hold. Small stake holders get substantially less THOR per VEN held, which will make non-node positions likely highly liquid and traded. This in turn reduces the value proposition for small holders.\n\n* It's a Chinese organization, meaning it has all the potential traps and risks of them. Most of the first hand information is in Chinese first. Even reading their English version of the Development Plan wil raise a few red flags since its filled with really poor grammar and comes off really unprofessional in the English language.\n\n* There is risk that the powernode users could come to dominate the network. \n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",

              "title": "---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n#Section B: Quantitative Valuation Model for VEN\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Equation of Exchange Model**\n\nVeChain tokens derive their value from generating THOR Power (THOR), which will be used to pay transaction costs within the network and blockchain. So if we can find estimate the transaction fees and THOR float generated and burned per year we could derive a price for THOR. This would be the expected future value of THOR, which can be discounted back to 2018 and then we can value different tiers of VEN stakes (nodes, masternodes, under 10K tokens) based on this information to arrive at a rational basis range for the price.\n\n**[Here is the output of the Excel Model](https://i.imgur.com/BIJTI2B.png)**\n\nThis model is inspired by Nodar Janashia's [model for valuing the Raiden Network](https://www.countup.io/cryptovaluations/raiden), which itself is inspired by Chris Brurniske's blogpost on creating a Cryptoasset Valuation. It uses the same underlying equation, the Fisher's Equation of Exchange (Quantity Theory of Money):\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equation_of_exchange\n\nThe equation MV= PQ can be thought of in terms of cryptocurrency, where \n\n* M is the monetary base (market cap) of the cryptocurrency\n* V is the velocity of the currency\n* P is the price of the digital medium underlying the currency transaction\n* Q is the quantity of the digital medium underlying the currency transaction\n\nIn order to value a cryptocurrency, we need to figure out the equation M = PQ/V for each year in future, divide it by the expected outstanding float and then discount the entire equation to derive the present value of this future utility. In my model I project the expected utility out 30 years until the year 2048, discounting back to 2018 and adding on a perpetuity for all years past 2048. \n\nThe term PQ is essentially the value of the cash flow that the \"economy\" of the cryptocurrency generates, for example for a cryptocurrency that focuses on being a token for online gaming (like FUN), the total value of the economy would be the gaming site revenue that is undertaken with the coin. For VEN, this term would be the value of the fees that are being paid in THOR power by companies and individuals for using the VeChain network. Once you divide that by velocity, you can discount it back to the present day. The final complexity is that VEN tokens generate a fixed amount of THOR per year depending on how much of a stake you hold, with nodes and masternodes generating more than individual VEN tokens. In addition the valuation is also dependent on how long the average person aims to hold the VEN token. If you hold a single token for just 1 year, you only get 0.15 THOR and however if you hold it for 6 then you are close to 1. The final sensitivity analysis is what will present the valuation depending on what the holder expect in terms of hold period in years and also how many VEN they have (node, masternode, under 10K).\n\nThe first section (Float Outstanding Schedule) aims to figure out how many THOR Power tokens will be available for burn each year. This depends on the outstanding float of VEN tokens. So far 12.6% of VEN has been burned, which leaves us with 867K VEN outstanding. I applied a 4% annual burn rate to this number, then figure out the number of THOR based on this number. The THOR reward per VEN can be figured out by applying the formula set out by VeChain Foundation:\n\nStake Type | VEN Held | THOR per year | THOR/VEN per year |  \n---------|----------|----------|----------|----------|----------\nThrudheim Masternode | 250,000 | 65,700 | 0.2628 | \nMjolnir Masternode | 150,000 | 39,420 | 0.2628 | \nThunder Node | 50,000 | 11,771 | 0.2354 | \nStrength Node | 10,000 | 2,080 | 0.208 |\nNon-Node | <10,000 |  | 0.15 | \n\nFor the model I break down users into the non-node bonded users (under 10K) and node bonded users (>10K). For the node bonded users, I will use an average of the masternode and node returns, which comes out to 0.2423 THOR/VEN each year. I assume a 50/50 split between these two groups.\n\nFor the transactional market, I'm assuming two different total relevant market inputs. One is the total market for counterfeit and fake goods economy, which [according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development accounts for $461 billion.](http://money.cnn.com/2016/04/18/news/economy/fake-purses-shoes-economy-counterfeit-trade/index.html) The second is the market for supply chain management software and various dApps, ICOs, extension...etc. The supply chain management market is around 17 billion according to Supply Chain Quarterly magazine, and another $120 billion will be the initial market for the other industries, growing to past $592 billion by 2038. The totality of these market segments is compounded by 5% every year, and growing to 2.58 trillion by 2048. I assume an S-Adoption curve that reaches 10% adoption in 2048 and starts in 2019, accelerating in 2022. The average fee is set at 3.5%, which I think is reasonable.\n\nNow the velocity of THOR is set at 1.0, because I don't expect it to be used as a currency for anything other than powering the VeChain network. The discount rate I used is 24%, or 3X the long term expected return on large cap equity (around 8%), to account for the risky nature of crypto.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nAfter deriving the NPV of THOR, we can give a valuation for VEN across a matrix of VEN stakes and average hold periods based on the assumptions within the image:\n\nStake Type (Node Tiers) | THOR/YEAR | 1 Year | 2 Years | 3 Years | 4 Years |  5 Years | 6 Years | 7 Years | 8 Years |  \n---------|----------|----------|----------|----------|----------|----------|----------|----------|----------\nThrudheim Masternode | 0.263 | $6.36 | $12.72 | $19.08 | $25.44 | $31.80 | $38.16 | $44.52 | $50.88 | \nMjolnir Masternode | 0.263 | $6.36 | $12.72 | $19.08 | $25.44 | $31.80 | $38.16 | $44.52 | $50.88 |\nThunder Node | 0.235 | $5.68 | $11.37| $17.05 | $22.73 | $28.41 | $34.10 | $39.78 | $45.46 | \nStrength Node | 0.208 | $5.03 | $10.06 | $15.03 | $20.12 | $25.15 | $30.18 | $35.21 | $40.24 |\nNon-Node | 0.15 | $3.63 | $7.25 | $10.88 | $14.51 | $18.14 | $21.76 | $25.39 | $29.02 | \n\n[Image of Table for Mobile Users](https://i.imgur.com/oZuBnOR.png)\n\nUltimately the valuation depends on what stake you hold in terms of node status and how long the average hold period is expected to be. Assuming a fundamental-based approach to investing, I think a 4 year average stake position period is reasonable which gives us between $14.51-$25.44 valuation. Longer periods and larger stakes take us up to $50.88 if you could secure a Thurdheim Masternode stake, a 10x premium over current prices.\n\nCreating a model for VEN really does make you think of these tokens as less of currencies and more as cryptoassets. People like to say that VEN pays a dividend in THOR, but I find it more helpful to think VEN as a financial derivative, its almost like a collaterized derivative contract. It also highlights how much of a disparity there is between the expected value for a non-node holder and the node holders. I expect this desire for node holders to move up to the next tier will put upward pressure. I should note that there is an additional complexity in that the top two node types (Thudheim and Mjolnir) get an additional 30% of THOR Power in the network, something I ignored in the model for simplicity. \n\nIn my view VEN and the general supply chain cryptos are some of the most promising, because they address real problems rather than imagined ones like so many crypto currencies. They also apply the properties of the blockchain to these problems in a way that makes sense rather than trying to fit something into the blockchain because its the trendy thing to do. Tracking identification numbers for unique items and luxury goods specifically is something that is well fitted for the blockchain. You can't fake them like you can fake a paper Certificate of Authenticity. \n\nAre these reasonable expectations? In the model by the year 2027 THOR Power is accounting for over $1.1 billion in transaction fees and by 2048 its up to $9 billion. Is a $9 billion annual fee economy in the long term something within the realm of reason? I think with so much revenue being lost to counterfeiting there will be a strong drive by companies to capture this back, and they will be willing to pay for a solution similar to VEN. If VEN can capture even 10% of that lost revenue, the holders are in for a great time over the long term. What about more optimistic adoption curves? Well if we ratchet up expectations we get the following 4 year average hold valuations:\n\n* 15% adoption: $20-$35 per VEN\n\n* 20% adoption: $27-$48 per VEN\n\n* 25% adoption: $34-$60 per VEN\n\n* 30% adoption: $40-$71 per VEN\n\nI think this provides an interesting way of valuing one of the most promising projects in crypto with a sceptic eye while fully recognizing the potential. That's what great about modelling, they allow you to keep your expectations within the realms of reality while also checking that VEN isn't overvalued, because most other coins in crypto definitely are.\n\n**Final Rating: UNDERVALUED**\n\n*DIsclaimer: I currently hold 560 VEN bought at $1.20. I will continue to hold and add on the dips.*\n\n",

These are the previous reports:\n\n* Part 1 - [A fundamental quantitative valuation of Bitcoin](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/7n47be/i_built_these_3_fundamental_valuation_models_for/)\n\n* Part 2 -  [A fundamental quantitative valuation of REQ (Request Network)](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/7njeff/a_fundamental_quantitative_valuation_of_req/)\n\nToday I will look at VeChain (known as VEN or VET), a supply chain focused cryptocurrency based in China. \n\n**If you already know about VeChain, you can skip to Section B for the valuation model**, however first a brief overview of the fundamentals:\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n#Section A: A fundamental analysis of VEN\n\n\n**Tech/Asset overview**\n\nVeChain Foundation: https://vechainfoundation.com/en/\n\nVeChain is a blockchain platform that focuses on the supply chain process, specifically the process of \"asset digitization\" through the combination of RFID/NFC tags and the immutability of a distributed blockchain. VeChain will use Ethereum as its core layer, and will be split into two tiers of different currencies:\n\n* VEN/VET: function of the VEN/VET is to serve as the intermedium of value and secure the network by being staked in nodes. VEN holders are rewarded with another asset called THOR POWER (THOR)\n\n* THOR Power represents the underlying cost of using the VeChain Blockchain and will be consumed (proportionally burnt) after certain blockchain operations are performed, such as transferring VET and executing smart contracts.\n\nYou can think of this an analogous to NEO and GAS, where the holding of one asset rewards with a type of \"dividend\" with another asset, and that secondary asset being what powers the network.\n\nThe equations and functions of this [can be found here](https://medium.com/@vechainofficial/vechain-apotheosis-part-ii-thor-power-forged-974111a93278)\n\n**Target Market Analysis: What is the transactional problem or inefficiency it attempts to solve?**\n\nOne of the major problems in global supply chain is the large amount of counterfeit items being passed around. Right now we have a very archaic system to deal with this, where for example luxury goods will have a paper \"certificate of authenticity\" that is really easy to copy and fake. \n\nVeChain plans to create a secure network where assets could be authenticated at the creation source and then tracked from party to party. Each item would have its own unique ID created with the SHA256 hash algorithm on the blockchain, and hence once entered in the platform could have its information accessed by anyone within the supply chain process. In addition the platform plans to provide the full spectrum of standard supply chain management tools through its smart contract platform and APIs. \n\nThe initial targeted industries will be those who suffer from the issue of asset validation and authentication, a problem all too familiar to Chinese supply chain companies. For example, think about a luxury handbag. A tiny RFID chip could be implanted in the packaging, or even within the bag itself, which would ensure ownership and authenticity.\n\n**What is the Development Team like?**\n\nVeChain has a technical development team of over 40 people, and nearly 150 in total. The key members on the team are:\n\n* Sunny Lu - Founder. Graduated from Shanghai Jiao Tong University, majored in Electronics and Communication\nEngineering. He has been served as IT Executive in Fortune 500 companies over 13 years, former CIO of Louis Vutton China.\n\n* Jay Zhang - Finance Director. Jay has worked for PwC and Deloitte as a senior manager for over 14 years.\n\n* Jianliang Gu - Technical Director. Jianliang was graduated from Shanghai University with master degree majored in Cybernetics. He was working in TCL communication technology as Technical Director.\n\n* Richard Fu - PR & Marketing Director. Ever 20 years' working experience in multinational enterprises such as Shangri-la Group and LVHM specializing in sales and marketing\n\n* Jerome Grilleres - Business Development. holds an MBA from London Business School and\na MSc in Computer Science. He is from Barclays France and has 8 years experience in Business Strategy and\nDevelopment in retail banking and 6 years in developing Real Time trading application in Investment Banks.\n\nIt is primarily based in China but has an office in Europe.\n\n**What current product/partnership exists?**\n\nVeChain does currently have several parts of a working product, from Android and iOS apps in the store to the initial platform code. Currently they are working on 3rd generation sensor for RFID tagging.\n\nPartnerships are perhaps VeChain's greatest initial strength. While certain partnerships like PriceWaterhouseCooper are oversold (at the time its largely an investment and advisory partnership), other partnerships within the Chinese industrial sphere are impressive:\n\n* Mlily, the largest memory foam mattress and smart bedding product research, development and manufacturer in China. Mlily will be utilizing VeChain Thor for Proof of Origin, Proof of Authenticity and Supply chain management. It is estimated that this project will add at least 20 million RFID chips every year for the next five years (blockchain data entry points) on chain. \n\n* Auto manufacturer Renault, an initial partnership to ensure that their manufacturing process is traceable across the supply chain.\n\n* VeChain officially established a cooperative relationship by signing a strategic agreement with Jiangsu Printed Electronics in November 2017. Both parties agreed that we would mutually explore and cooperate towards solutions within blockchain-centric IoT equipment.\n\n* Recommended by and initiated by a government member for Hubei province, VeChain partnered up with Hubei Sanxin Cultural Media Ltd to develop a series of solutions using VeChain blockchain technologies for the proof of origin, the supply chain management and the accounting of digital publications and ebooks. The first phase of this partnership will last for 2 years, to be extended at a later date. Importantly, if this pilot goes as planned the government of Hubei will recommend VeChain Thor Digital publication tracking solutions to The State Administration of Press, Publication, Radio, Film and Television of the People’s Republic of China. \n\n**What are the weaknesses/issues related with this cryptocurrency?**\n\n* Several other strong competitors within this same field, primarily Walton and WABI. VeChain will have to differentiate itself from them with a superior product or lower fees if it aims to secure the Chinese contracts. \n\n* Getting the ROI on THOR that will surpass your initial VET investment will likely require a multi-year hold. Small stake holders get substantially less THOR per VEN held, which will make non-node positions likely highly liquid and traded. This in turn reduces the value proposition for small holders.\n\n* It's a Chinese organization, meaning it has all the potential traps and risks of them. Most of the first hand information is in Chinese first. Even reading their English version of the Development Plan wil raise a few red flags since its filled with really poor grammar and comes off really unprofessional in the English language.\n\n* There is risk that the powernode users could come to dominate the network. \n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",

Currently they are working on 3rd generation sensor for RFID tagging.\n\nPartnerships are perhaps VeChain's greatest initial strength. While certain partnerships like PriceWaterhouseCooper are oversold (at the time its largely an investment and advisory partnership), other partnerships within the Chinese industrial sphere are impressive:\n\n* Mlily, the largest memory foam mattress and smart bedding product research, development and manufacturer in China. Mlily will be utilizing VeChain Thor for Proof of Origin, Proof of Authenticity and Supply chain management. It is estimated that this project will add at least 20 million RFID chips every year for the next five years (blockchain data entry points) on chain. \n\n* Auto manufacturer Renault, an initial partnership to ensure that their manufacturing process is traceable across the supply chain.\n\n* VeChain officially established a cooperative relationship by signing a strategic agreement with Jiangsu Printed Electronics in November 2017. Both parties agreed that we would mutually explore and cooperate towards solutions within blockchain-centric IoT equipment.\n\n* Recommended by and initiated by a government member for Hubei province, VeChain partnered up with Hubei Sanxin Cultural Media Ltd to develop a series of solutions using VeChain blockchain technologies for the proof of origin, the supply chain management and the accounting of digital publications and ebooks. The first phase of this partnership will last for 2 years, to be extended at a later date. Importantly, if this pilot goes as planned the government of Hubei will recommend VeChain Thor Digital publication tracking solutions to The State Administration of Press, Publication, Radio, Film and Television of the People’s Republic of China. \n\n**What are the weaknesses/issues related with this cryptocurrency?**\n\n* Several other strong competitors within this same field, primarily Walton and WABI.

              "title": "This a continuation in my series of analytical reports for various cryptocurrencies, from a quantitative Excel modelling and fundamental perspective. These are the previous reports:\n\n* Part 1 - [A fundamental quantitative valuation of Bitcoin](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/7n47be/i_built_these_3_fundamental_valuation_models_for/)\n\n* Part 2 -  [A fundamental quantitative valuation of REQ (Request Network)](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/7njeff/a_fundamental_quantitative_valuation_of_req/)\n\nToday I will look at VeChain (known as VEN or VET), a supply chain focused cryptocurrency based in China. \n\n**If you already know about VeChain, you can skip to Section B for the valuation model**, however first a brief overview of the fundamentals:\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n#Section A: A fundamental analysis of VEN\n\n\n**Tech/Asset overview**\n\nVeChain Foundation: https://vechainfoundation.com/en/\n\nVeChain is a blockchain platform that focuses on the supply chain process, specifically the process of \"asset digitization\" through the combination of RFID/NFC tags and the immutability of a distributed blockchain. VeChain will use Ethereum as its core layer, and will be split into two tiers of different currencies:\n\n* VEN/VET: function of the VEN/VET is to serve as the intermedium of value and secure the network by being staked in nodes. VEN holders are rewarded with another asset called THOR POWER (THOR)\n\n* THOR Power represents the underlying cost of using the VeChain Blockchain and will be consumed (proportionally burnt) after certain blockchain operations are performed, such as transferring VET and executing smart contracts.\n\nYou can think of this an analogous to NEO and GAS, where the holding of one asset rewards with a type of \"dividend\" with another asset, and that secondary asset being what powers the network.\n\nThe equations and functions of this [can be found here](https://medium.com/@vechainofficial/vechain-apotheosis-part-ii-thor-power-forged-974111a93278)\n\n**Target Market Analysis: What is the transactional problem or inefficiency it attempts to solve?**\n\nOne of the major problems in global supply chain is the large amount of counterfeit items being passed around. Right now we have a very archaic system to deal with this, where for example luxury goods will have a paper \"certificate of authenticity\" that is really easy to copy and fake. \n\nVeChain plans to create a secure network where assets could be authenticated at the creation source and then tracked from party to party. Each item would have its own unique ID created with the SHA256 hash algorithm on the blockchain, and hence once entered in the platform could have its information accessed by anyone within the supply chain process. In addition the platform plans to provide the full spectrum of standard supply chain management tools through its smart contract platform and APIs. \n\nThe initial targeted industries will be those who suffer from the issue of asset validation and authentication, a problem all too familiar to Chinese supply chain companies. For example, think about a luxury handbag. A tiny RFID chip could be implanted in the packaging, or even within the bag itself, which would ensure ownership and authenticity.\n\n**What is the Development Team like?**\n\nVeChain has a technical development team of over 40 people, and nearly 150 in total. The key members on the team are:\n\n* Sunny Lu - Founder. Graduated from Shanghai Jiao Tong University, majored in Electronics and Communication\nEngineering. He has been served as IT Executive in Fortune 500 companies over 13 years, former CIO of Louis Vutton China.\n\n* Jay Zhang - Finance Director. Jay has worked for PwC and Deloitte as a senior manager for over 14 years.\n\n* Jianliang Gu - Technical Director. Jianliang was graduated from Shanghai University with master degree majored in Cybernetics. He was working in TCL communication technology as Technical Director.\n\n* Richard Fu - PR & Marketing Director. Ever 20 years' working experience in multinational enterprises such as Shangri-la Group and LVHM specializing in sales and marketing\n\n* Jerome Grilleres - Business Development. holds an MBA from London Business School and\na MSc in Computer Science.

While everyone on Reddit was advising to ‘hodl’, last night I couldn’t resist to make some changes in my wallet. I read so many about the different coins here and I started to feel like I’m making the wrong choices. It began when I bought ETH (when it was a bit over $800 ) and invested that money in LTC and XRP (that seemed to be rising). While ETH was on fire, LTC dropped. So basically what I did yesterday was trying to undo this ‘mistakes’ by trading LTC for ETH (at a high price); selling my (scammy) XRP and increase my NEO. I took off with $1500 and my estimated value now is about $1300. But I feel that I do need some advice on how my wallet is built up now and how to handle this kind of situations. Could anyone give me a kickstart here ?\n\nMy wallet:\nETH: 0,40349418\nNEO: 2,27\nBQX: 9,99\nXRP: 10,94\nADA: 49,95\nXLM: 71,93\nXVG:  217,78\nREQ: 56,94\nICX: 9,99\nNULS: 19,98\n\n\nAny comment is much appreciated!!\n\n",

              "title": "This a continuation in my series of analytical reports for various cryptocurrencies, from a quantitative Excel modelling and fundamental perspective. These are the previous reports:\n\n* Part 1 - [A fundamental quantitative valuation of Bitcoin](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/7n47be/i_built_these_3_fundamental_valuation_models_for/)\n\n* Part 2 -  [A fundamental quantitative valuation of REQ (Request Network)](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/7njeff/a_fundamental_quantitative_valuation_of_req/)\n\nToday I will look at VeChain (known as VEN or VET), a supply chain focused cryptocurrency based in China. \n\n**If you already know about VeChain, you can skip to Section B for the valuation model**, however first a brief overview of the fundamentals:\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n#Section A: A fundamental analysis of VEN\n\n\n**Tech/Asset overview**\n\nVeChain Foundation: https://vechainfoundation.com/en/\n\nVeChain is a blockchain platform that focuses on the supply chain process, specifically the process of \"asset digitization\" through the combination of RFID/NFC tags and the immutability of a distributed blockchain. VeChain will use Ethereum as its core layer, and will be split into two tiers of different currencies:\n\n* VEN/VET: function of the VEN/VET is to serve as the intermedium of value and secure the network by being staked in nodes. VEN holders are rewarded with another asset called THOR POWER (THOR)\n\n* THOR Power represents the underlying cost of using the VeChain Blockchain and will be consumed (proportionally burnt) after certain blockchain operations are performed, such as transferring VET and executing smart contracts.\n\nYou can think of this an analogous to NEO and GAS, where the holding of one asset rewards with a type of \"dividend\" with another asset, and that secondary asset being what powers the network.\n\nThe equations and functions of this [can be found here](https://medium.com/@vechainofficial/vechain-apotheosis-part-ii-thor-power-forged-974111a93278)\n\n**Target Market Analysis: What is the transactional problem or inefficiency it attempts to solve?**\n\nOne of the major problems in global supply chain is the large amount of counterfeit items being passed around. Right now we have a very archaic system to deal with this, where for example luxury goods will have a paper \"certificate of authenticity\" that is really easy to copy and fake. \n\nVeChain plans to create a secure network where assets could be authenticated at the creation source and then tracked from party to party. Each item would have its own unique ID created with the SHA256 hash algorithm on the blockchain, and hence once entered in the platform could have its information accessed by anyone within the supply chain process. In addition the platform plans to provide the full spectrum of standard supply chain management tools through its smart contract platform and APIs. \n\nThe initial targeted industries will be those who suffer from the issue of asset validation and authentication, a problem all too familiar to Chinese supply chain companies. For example, think about a luxury handbag. A tiny RFID chip could be implanted in the packaging, or even within the bag itself, which would ensure ownership and authenticity.\n\n**What is the Development Team like?**\n\nVeChain has a technical development team of over 40 people, and nearly 150 in total. The key members on the team are:\n\n* Sunny Lu - Founder. Graduated from Shanghai Jiao Tong University, majored in Electronics and Communication\nEngineering. He has been served as IT Executive in Fortune 500 companies over 13 years, former CIO of Louis Vutton China.\n\n* Jay Zhang - Finance Director. Jay has worked for PwC and Deloitte as a senior manager for over 14 years.\n\n* Jianliang Gu - Technical Director. Jianliang was graduated from Shanghai University with master degree majored in Cybernetics. He was working in TCL communication technology as Technical Director.\n\n* Richard Fu - PR & Marketing Director. Ever 20 years' working experience in multinational enterprises such as Shangri-la Group and LVHM specializing in sales and marketing\n\n* Jerome Grilleres - Business Development. holds an MBA from London Business School and\na MSc in Computer Science. He is from Barclays France and has 8 years experience in Business Strategy and\nDevelopment in retail banking and 6 years in developing Real Time trading application in Investment Banks.\n\nIt is primarily based in China but has an office in Europe.\n\n**What current product/partnership exists?**\n\nVeChain does currently have several parts of a working product, from Android and iOS apps in the store to the initial platform code. Currently they are working on 3rd generation sensor for RFID tagging.\n\nPartnerships are perhaps VeChain's greatest initial strength. While certain partnerships like PriceWaterhouseCooper are oversold (at the time its largely an investment and advisory partnership), other partnerships within the Chinese industrial sphere are impressive:\n\n* Mlily, the largest memory foam mattress and smart bedding product research, development and manufacturer in China. Mlily will be utilizing VeChain Thor for Proof of Origin, Proof of Authenticity and Supply chain management. It is estimated that this project will add at least 20 million RFID chips every year for the next five years (blockchain data entry points) on chain. \n\n* Auto manufacturer Renault, an initial partnership to ensure that their manufacturing process is traceable across the supply chain.\n\n* VeChain officially established a cooperative relationship by signing a strategic agreement with Jiangsu Printed Electronics in November 2017. Both parties agreed that we would mutually explore and cooperate towards solutions within blockchain-centric IoT equipment.\n\n* Recommended by and initiated by a government member for Hubei province, VeChain partnered up with Hubei Sanxin Cultural Media Ltd to develop a series of solutions using VeChain blockchain technologies for the proof of origin, the supply chain management and the accounting of digital publications and ebooks. The first phase of this partnership will last for 2 years, to be extended at a later date. Importantly, if this pilot goes as planned the government of Hubei will recommend VeChain Thor Digital publication tracking solutions to The State Administration of Press, Publication, Radio, Film and Television of the People’s Republic of China. \n\n**What are the weaknesses/issues related with this cryptocurrency?**\n\n* Several other strong competitors within this same field, primarily Walton and WABI. VeChain will have to differentiate itself from them with a superior product or lower fees if it aims to secure the Chinese contracts. \n\n* Getting the ROI on THOR that will surpass your initial VET investment will likely require a multi-year hold. Small stake holders get substantially less THOR per VEN held, which will make non-node positions likely highly liquid and traded. This in turn reduces the value proposition for small holders.\n\n* It's a Chinese organization, meaning it has all the potential traps and risks of them. Most of the first hand information is in Chinese first. Even reading their English version of the Development Plan wil raise a few red flags since its filled with really poor grammar and comes off really unprofessional in the English language.\n\n* There is risk that the powernode users could come to dominate the network. \n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",

So if we can find estimate the transaction fees and THOR float generated and burned per year we could derive a price for THOR. This would be the expected future value of THOR, which can be discounted back to 2018 and then we can value different tiers of VEN stakes (nodes, masternodes, under 10K tokens) based on this information to arrive at a rational basis range for the price.\n\n**[Here is the output of the Excel Model](https://i.imgur.com/BIJTI2B.png)**\n\nThis model is inspired by Nodar Janashia's [model for valuing the Raiden Network](https://www.countup.io/cryptovaluations/raiden), which itself is inspired by Chris Brurniske's blogpost on creating a Cryptoasset Valuation. It uses the same underlying equation, the Fisher's Equation of Exchange (Quantity Theory of Money):\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equation_of_exchange\n\nThe equation MV= PQ can be thought of in terms of cryptocurrency, where \n\n* M is the monetary base (market cap) of the cryptocurrency\n* V is the velocity of the currency\n* P is the price of the digital medium underlying the currency transaction\n* Q is the quantity of the digital medium underlying the currency transaction\n\nIn order to value a cryptocurrency, we need to figure out the equation M = PQ/V for each year in future, divide it by the expected outstanding float and then discount the entire equation to derive the present value of this future utility. In my model I project the expected utility out 30 years until the year 2048, discounting back to 2018 and adding on a perpetuity for all years past 2048. \n\nThe term PQ is essentially the value of the cash flow that the \"economy\" of the cryptocurrency generates, for example for a cryptocurrency that focuses on being a token for online gaming (like FUN), the total value of the economy would be the gaming site revenue that is undertaken with the coin. For VEN, this term would be the value of the fees that are being paid in THOR power by companies and individuals for using the VeChain network. Once you divide that by velocity, you can discount it back to the present day. The final complexity is that VEN tokens generate a fixed amount of THOR per year depending on how much of a stake you hold, with nodes and masternodes generating more than individual VEN tokens. In addition the valuation is also dependent on how long the average person aims to hold the VEN token. If you hold a single token for just 1 year, you only get 0.15 THOR and however if you hold it for 6 then you are close to 1. The final sensitivity analysis is what will present the valuation depending on what the holder expect in terms of hold period in years and also how many VEN they have (node, masternode, under 10K).\n\nThe first section (Float Outstanding Schedule) aims to figure out how many THOR Power tokens will be available for burn each year. This depends on the outstanding float of VEN tokens. So far 12.6% of VEN has been burned, which leaves us with 867K VEN outstanding. I applied a 4% annual burn rate to this number, then figure out the number of THOR based on this number. The THOR reward per VEN can be figured out by applying the formula set out by VeChain Foundation:\n\nStake Type | VEN Held | THOR per year | THOR/VEN per year |  \n---------|----------|----------|----------|----------|----------\nThrudheim Masternode | 250,000 | 65,700 | 0.2628 | \nMjolnir Masternode | 150,000 | 39,420 | 0.2628 | \nThunder Node | 50,000 | 11,771 | 0.2354 | \nStrength Node | 10,000 | 2,080 | 0.208 |\nNon-Node | <10,000 |  | 0.15 | \n\nFor the model I break down users into the non-node bonded users (under 10K) and node bonded users (>10K). For the node bonded users, I will use an average of the masternode and node returns, which comes out to 0.2423 THOR/VEN each year. I assume a 50/50 split between these two groups.\n\nFor the transactional market, I'm assuming two different total relevant market inputs. One is the total market for counterfeit and fake goods economy, which [according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development accounts for $461 billion.](http://money.cnn.com/2016/04/18/news/economy/fake-purses-shoes-economy-counterfeit-trade/index.html) The second is the market for supply chain management software and various dApps, ICOs, extension...etc. The supply chain management market is around 17 billion according to Supply Chain Quarterly magazine, and another $120 billion will be the initial market for the other industries, growing to past $592 billion by 2038. The totality of these market segments is compounded by 5% every year, and growing to 2.58 trillion by 2048. I assume an S-Adoption curve that reaches 10% adoption in 2048 and starts in 2019, accelerating in 2022. The average fee is set at 3.5%, which I think is reasonable.\n\nNow the velocity of THOR is set at 1.0, because I don't expect it to be used as a currency for anything other than powering the VeChain network. The discount rate I used is 24%, or 3X the long term expected return on large cap equity (around 8%), to account for the risky nature of crypto.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nAfter deriving the NPV of THOR, we can give a valuation for VEN across a matrix of VEN stakes and average hold periods based on the assumptions within the image:\n\nStake Type (Node Tiers) | THOR/YEAR | 1 Year | 2 Years | 3 Years | 4 Years |  5 Years | 6 Years | 7 Years | 8 Years |  \n---------|----------|----------|----------|----------|----------|----------|----------|----------|----------\nThrudheim Masternode | 0.263 | $6.36 | $12.72 | $19.08 | $25.44 | $31.80 | $38.16 | $44.52 | $50.88 | \nMjolnir Masternode | 0.263 | $6.36 | $12.72 | $19.08 | $25.44 | $31.80 | $38.16 | $44.52 | $50.88 |\nThunder Node | 0.235 | $5.68 | $11.37| $17.05 | $22.73 | $28.41 | $34.10 | $39.78 | $45.46 | \nStrength Node | 0.208 | $5.03 | $10.06 | $15.03 | $20.12 | $25.15 | $30.18 | $35.21 | $40.24 |\nNon-Node | 0.15 | $3.63 | $7.25 | $10.88 | $14.51 | $18.14 | $21.76 | $25.39 | $29.02 | \n\n[Image of Table for Mobile Users](https://i.imgur.com/oZuBnOR.png)\n\nUltimately the valuation depends on what stake you hold in terms of node status and how long the average hold period is expected to be. Assuming a fundamental-based approach to investing, I think a 4 year average stake position period is reasonable which gives us between $14.51-$25.44 valuation. Longer periods and larger stakes take us up to $50.88 if you could secure a Thurdheim Masternode stake, a 10x premium over current prices.\n\nCreating a model for VEN really does make you think of these tokens as less of currencies and more as cryptoassets. People like to say that VEN pays a dividend in THOR, but I find it more helpful to think VEN as a financial derivative, its almost like a collaterized derivative contract. It also highlights how much of a disparity there is between the expected value for a non-node holder and the node holders. I expect this desire for node holders to move up to the next tier will put upward pressure. I should note that there is an additional complexity in that the top two node types (Thudheim and Mjolnir) get an additional 30% of THOR Power in the network, something I ignored in the model for simplicity. \n\nIn my view VEN and the general supply chain cryptos are some of the most promising, because they address real problems rather than imagined ones like so many crypto currencies. They also apply the properties of the blockchain to these problems in a way that makes sense rather than trying to fit something into the blockchain because its the trendy thing to do. Tracking identification numbers for unique items and luxury goods specifically is something that is well fitted for the blockchain. You can't fake them like you can fake a paper Certificate of Authenticity. \n\nAre these reasonable expectations? In the model by the year 2027 THOR Power is accounting for over $1.1 billion in transaction fees and by 2048 its up to $9 billion. Is a $9 billion annual fee economy in the long term something within the realm of reason? I think with so much revenue being lost to counterfeiting there will be a strong drive by companies to capture this back, and they will be willing to pay for a solution similar to VEN. If VEN can capture even 10% of that lost revenue, the holders are in for a great time over the long term. What about more optimistic adoption curves? Well if we ratchet up expectations we get the following 4 year average hold valuations:\n\n* 15% adoption: $20-$35 per VEN\n\n* 20% adoption: $27-$48 per VEN\n\n* 25% adoption: $34-$60 per VEN\n\n* 30% adoption: $40-$71 per VEN\n\nI think this provides an interesting way of valuing one of the most promising projects in crypto with a sceptic eye while fully recognizing the potential. That's what great about modelling, they allow you to keep your expectations within the realms of reality while also checking that VEN isn't overvalued, because most other coins in crypto definitely are.\n\n**Final Rating: UNDERVALUED**\n\n*DIsclaimer: I currently hold 560 VEN bought at $1.20. I will continue to hold and add on the dips.*\n\n",

In addition, there are a lot of skillful freelancer without a proper certificate or education (many of them are self-taught), so it is always pretty hard for companies to find good personnel in this business. Until now, companies often just didn't pay those, either because in their opinion the discovery didn't qualify for the published bounty or because it was unclear who gets paid since there were mostly a group of people discovering a certain issue. Freelancer not getting paid damaged the security-industry obviously. But with Bounty0x, companies can set bounties for discovering safety issues. They are binded to the smart contract and as soon as someone discovers an issue, he will get rewarded automatically. This will attract those bounty hunters which will not only increase overall network security but also let them getting paid for their work, which is awesome.\n\n\nThis is just a perfect example of how smart contracts can be used to create a benefit for both companies and people. To me it looks like an ideal investment since it's not even top200 in MC. \n\nI know i'm obviously shilling hard but it's an idea i can get behind and if it gets people attention, many security issues for example in cryptoexchanges can be removed which would be a huge benefit for the cryptocommunity overall.

              "title": "So there's been quite a bit of noise around SALT over the past ~2 weeks, and with news surfacing every couple days it seems like a good point to take stock of where the SALT loan arbitrage opportunity really stands.\n\nFor those unaware, SALT is a loan platform that allows members to post cryptocurrency as collateral in order to receive a fiat loan. Members have the option to repay loans with SALT, which is the native token of the platform. SALT is redeemable at a fixed price, currently $27.50, and the announcement accompanying platform launch included an unexpected note that loan principal could be repaid with SALT (pre-launch messaging indicated interest only). Currently, SALT trades at around $14.\n\nOur take is that the loan arbitrage is real, but because SALT can't be used for early repayment (as clarified by a SALT employee about a day ago) it's hard to say how quickly the exchange price will converge towards the $27.50 redemption value on the SALT platform. On one hand, this could be a good thing for those holding longer term or interested in actually getting a loan approved before buying SALT, but it's a negative event to speculators hoping for a quick flip. We are also not certain that SALT will not introduce further restrictive conditions, so for this and other reasons we will not be entering a position in SALT.",

Just finished sprint 1 and bug bounty. Uraiden testing on mainnet of ETH network by many dapps. This is a huge huge part of scaling the entire ETH network. If/when they go live the token is scare and has working utility, I expect big things.\n\nLEND - similar practical use case as SALT. Different but should be used often on platform and still a nice cheap buy in.\n\nLoopring - making wallet to wallet trading a potential reality so you don’t store coins on exchanges. Really cool idea.\n\nWaBi - rfid counterfeiting like vechain, but at manufacturers level. Big in china. Working platform\n\nINTS - privacy coin with tons of room to grow\n",

While everyone on Reddit was advising to ‘hodl’, last night I couldn’t resist to make some changes in my wallet. I read so many about the different coins here and I started to feel like I’m making the wrong choices. It began when I bought ETH (when it was a bit over $800 ) and invested that money in LTC and XRP (that seemed to be rising). While ETH was on fire, LTC dropped. So basically what I did yesterday was trying to undo this ‘mistakes’ by trading LTC for ETH (at a high price); selling my (scammy) XRP and increase my NEO. I took off with $1500 and my estimated value now is about $1300. But I feel that I do need some advice on how my wallet is built up now and how to handle this kind of situations. Could anyone give me a kickstart here ?\n\nMy wallet:\nETH: 0,40349418\nNEO: 2,27\nBQX: 9,99\nXRP: 10,94\nADA: 49,95\nXLM: 71,93\nXVG:  217,78\nREQ: 56,94\nICX: 9,99\nNULS: 19,98\n\n\nAny comment is much appreciated!!\n\n",

              "title": "Thinking it is a scam is an understandable initial reaction. I have done much research and have decided it is unlikely to be a scam. It may fail for other reasons but I am convinced the company is operating in good faith. My reasoning is as follows.\n\n* A scam would probably have exited by now. They spent a month raising $1m (now more like $2-3m given the runup in the crypto market). Then they spent two months without any fundraising, just providing updates to investors, releasing a demo video of the product, and re-branding from Pink to PinkDate to avoid confusion with Pink.io (a company that provides models-on-demand, not escorts). They even pushed back the Pre-ICO by about a week. This is behavior inconsistent with people trying to raise a lot of money quickly and then take off.\n\n* Scammers would probably not be as concerned about opsec as /u/ecnei has been. Check his Reddit history. He is active on the Monero community in dissecting privacy issues with Monero. His concerns strongly suggest someone who is trying to avoid a large government/multinational investigation rather than jilted ICO bagholders.\n\n* Bothering with Monero at all is a sign that they are not scammers, because it makes the investment process more complex. They strongly recommend Monero for investor privacy. An ICO scam would likely take mainly ETH, as it is the least friction to raise money quickly. Then the scammers could Shapeshift the ETH into Monero and take off.\n\n* For Pre-ICO they currently require a minimum investment size of ~$1000. This suggests they are not trying to scam nickel and dime investors. It drastically increases investment friction, which a scammer would have no motive to do.\n\n* Marketing competence is incredibly lacking. They have had several months now to raise hype and startup capital. Instead, they have spent their time releasing Medium articles, a demo video that is explanatory but not slick/exciting, and communicating behind-the-scenes infrastructure changes to investors. If they are scammers, they have done a terrible job. To their credit, their marketing is improving. But I believe scammers would have *started* with a marketing push rather than starting one several months later.\n\n* They did not even release a whitepaper for about three months, which makes sense for people who are not really trying to create new crypto tech, but does not make sense for people trying to appeal to get-rich-quick ICO investors. \n\nHaving read through their [Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/pinkdate/shared_invite/enQtMjQ0NjI2MDM0ODY1LWJhMGQ5ZTY4ZjRmODFlMTRlYWU3NDUwYWMzMDA1MGVlZGE1NThlN2ZjMWE2NGYxODRmNmY2NTg1YWI2MWM0YTk), their [Medium](https://medium.com/@PinkDate) articles, etc I have become convinced they are earnest and have a solid business plan. The thought and care they put into their [opsec](https://medium.com/@PinkDate/pink-app-trading-latency-for-anonymity-and-other-techniques-815ee21c6da4), as well as their in-depth knowledge of the sex industry, suggests they are what they claim to be: individuals with startup and opsec experience who see how crypto can be leveraged to meet a unique and extremely lucrative market.\n\nUltimately no answer can really be fully satisfying, because at the end of the day, they could just be high IQ scammers (and admit as such in their [FAQ](https://pinkdate.is/faq/)).\n\nI believe this is a calculated risk with a very high chance of paying off. Most ICOs are vaporware with a tenuous business plan involving staking or network incentives. The teams may not be anonymous, but even with the rise in ICO scams, nobody has been prosecuted because the crypto space is not regulated. The BitConnect people have gotten incredibly rich and will never pay a penny in restitution or see a day in prison.\n\nTo me, the risk of an anonymous team with a reasonable business proposition is much less than the risk of a named team with only \"network incentives\" for a network that may never actually exist. But I cannot deny that it *is* a risk.",
